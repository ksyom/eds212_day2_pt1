## Derivatives in R
For R markdown remember that you have to put the code in the code chunks to run

Find the derivative of $$f(x) = 5x^2$$

```{r}
ex_1 <- expression(5 * x ^ 2)

my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x")
#we're telling it to take the derivative with respect to x.
my_derivative

#i want to find the slope at x = 2.8
x <- 2.8
eval(my_derivative)
```

a word immediately followed by parentheses, like seq() or expression() in R are called functions

Find the slope of $$g(Z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$$

```{r}
#second way to calculate derivatives
gz <- expression(2 * z ^ 2 -10.5 * x ^ 2 + 4.1)

dg_dz <- D(gz,"z")
dg_dz

#can be single or double quotes

#lets evaluate the slope over a range of values

z <- seq(from = -3, to = 4, by = 0.5)

#evaluate it!

eval(dg_dz)
```
