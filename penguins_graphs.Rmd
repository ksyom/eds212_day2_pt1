```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
#no quotes in tidyverse, calling for package
#to install, install.packages in the console("packagename") in quotes. Just typed in console install.packages("palmerpenguins), so now I can call for it
library(palmerpenguins)
```

typing view(penguins) in the console brings up the data frame

```{r}
#first 6 lines
head(penguins)
#last 6 lines
tail(penguins)
```

Scatterplot of body mass versus flipper length:

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color = species))
#this tells us that the color is dependent on the species
```

anytime you want to change any part of a graph's aesthetics, you do it through aes (see previous code chunk)
